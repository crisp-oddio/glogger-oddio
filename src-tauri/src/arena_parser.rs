//! Casino arena fight tracker.
//!
//! Project: Gorgon's casino arena is run by the NPC **Kuzavek**, who narrates
//! every match on the `[NPC Chatter]` chat channel. Two things are recoverable
//! from that narration, with no manual input from the player:
//!
//!   1. **The matchup** — an intro pair announces the two fighters, e.g.
//!      `Introducing our two competitors! On the far side is the mighty ogre OTIS!`
//!      followed by `And on the side nearest me is Leo The Walking Cat!`
//!   2. **The result** — a later line names the winner or the loser, e.g.
//!      `Get that cat some milk. Leo wins!` or `Otis has been defeated!`.
//!
//! The player's own bet is placed via a `Player.log` talk screen (NPC 5712) and
//! is not needed here: this tracker only records *who fought whom and who won*,
//! so the dashboard can rank fighters and predict the favorite in any matchup.
//!
//! Design: a small state machine ([`ArenaTracker`]) fed every parsed chat
//! message. Kuzavek's flowery prose means fighter names are wrapped in flavor
//! text, so we match against a known roster (seeded with the current 7 fighters)
//! by whole-word, case-insensitive comparison. New fighters are auto-discovered
//! from the clean `"<Name> wins!"` / `"<Name> loses!"` result phrasings and
//! folded into the roster so future matchups involving them are recognized.
//!
//! Because a result line is scoped to the *pending* pair (we already know the
//! two fighters from the intro), we don't need the winner's name to sit next to
//! the verb — a line like `Ushug was definitely not expecting this! He's been
//! defeated!` resolves fine: it carries a loss verb and names exactly one of the
//! pending pair (Ushug), so the other fighter is the winner.
