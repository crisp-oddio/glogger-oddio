//! Survey session aggregator — Phase 5 brains.
//!
//! Subscribes to [`PlayerEvent`]s as they flow through the coordinator and:
//!
//! - Detects survey-map crafting and use, recording rows in `survey_sessions`
//!   and `survey_uses`.
//! - Drives the session lifecycle state machine (manual / crafting / first-use
//!   start; auto-end for crafting sessions when consumed catches crafted).
//! - Performs **A3 stitching**: when a Mining context opens within 60s of a
//!   survey-map use being consumed, gains in that mining cycle get the
//!   originating `survey_use_id` injected into their `ItemProvenance` so
//!   downstream queries can group "all loot from this survey use".
//! - Tracks per-kind windows: Basic (single tick), Motherlode (one mining
//!   cycle), Multihit (different-entity OR 30min via DB-backed
//!   `open_multihit_nodes`).
//!
//! See `docs/plans/survey-tracker-rewrite.md` for the full design and
//! `docs/architecture/survey-mechanics.md` for the kind-specific game
//! mechanics this implements.
